# Soulbound NFTs

_TLDR: Non-Transferable NFTs_

There are plenty of applications where the cryptographically provable ownership of an NFT is valuable but is hindered by transferability. For example, Stanford's [CS 251 course completion NFT](https://opensea.io/assets/matic/0xe375518c59E80758e508d260B7a740b57c2e431D/0/) loses its usefulness if it's purchasable in open markets. POAPs are similarly hurt by transferability. Check out [Vitalik's recent post](https://vitalik.ca/general/2022/01/26/soulbound.html) for more examples and explanations.
